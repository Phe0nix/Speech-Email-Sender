# Speech-Email-Sender
Send email with speech recognition means just start talking and send emails. No hands involve for typing. This is just for practice of Web Speech API, not a actual project.

### See Demo Here - [Speech Email Sender](https://phe0nix.github.io/Speech-Email-Sender/)

### Instructions: 

1. Click Start button and click 'allow' to use microphone if popup comes up.
2. After allowing, just start talking means your subject text.
3. Some Commands:

| Signs             | Commands
| ----------------- |:--------:
| Comma (,)         | `comma`
| Fullstop (.)      | `full stop` 
| Exclamation (!)   | `exclamation sign`
| question mark (?) | `question mark`
| Delete something  | `delete now`

4. After completing your subject, say `'line break'` to break the line for your body content. After break, the body content part will start.
5. Say `'paragraph break'` for provide break between two lines.
6. When everything's done means after completing your body part, say `'send email'` to open your default email provider(whether it's a app or gmail account) and send mail specifically via gmail, just say `'send gmail'` and it'll open gmail.com and then just edit your recipient's email address and send email.
7. If you send email without provide `'line break'` command (see point 4), then subject and body both will take the same content.
